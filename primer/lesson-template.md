# Lesson Artifact Template

Every session writes one `LESSON.md` to `lessons/<domain-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<lesson-slug>.md`. The template is strict — deviations are a smell. The artifact is the unit of value; the conversation is just how it gets made.

## Filename

`lessons/<domain-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<lesson-slug>.md`

- `domain-slug`: the top-level domain from the learner's `topic-index.md` that this lesson belongs to. Domains are **per-instance**, not a fixed set — they come from the learner's own topic map. (The starter pack happens to ship `ai-agentic`, `distributed-systems`, `event-driven-architecture`, `docker`, `backend-engineering`, but another learner's index will have different ones.)
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: session start date.
- `lesson-slug`: 2–6 hyphenated words, content-bearing (`consensus-and-raft`, not `lesson-3`).

## Body sections (in order)

### `# <Lesson Title>`

Title is descriptive, not cute. "Consensus without implementing Paxos" beats "Going deep on consensus".

### `## TL;DR`

3–5 bullets. Each a falsifiable invariant — the thing worth keeping. Written for someone scanning the file in two years to remember whether they covered this.

### `## Where you started`

The Elicit-step anchor: the learner's mental model entering the session. One paragraph. This is the receipts — proof the system actually calibrated rather than running a generic curriculum.

### `## The problem`

Primitives → failure modes. What's the underlying problem before any tool? What specifically goes wrong without one? Concrete, with a named scenario.

### `## The pattern(s)`

Worked example → faded example → free problem. Diagrams inline (Mermaid for sequence/state/flow; ASCII for in-terminal recall).

For multi-pattern lessons (e.g., "outbox vs CDC vs change-streams"), each pattern gets its own subsection.

### `## Tradeoffs`

A table. When does pattern X beat Y? Cost axes: operational complexity, latency, consistency, blast radius on failure, team cognitive load. Honest, not advocacy.

### `## Q&A`

The substantive questions the learner asked and how they were answered. Verbatim where it matters. This is high-signal — it captures the *specific* gaps this learner had on this day.

### `## Open threads`

Things pulled-on and set down. Each entry is a one-liner with enough hook to revisit.

> - The CRAQ paper — read before next replication lesson.
> - Why does Postgres logical replication ship deltas, not state? — open.

These also append to `learner/open-questions.md`.

### `## Retrieval prompts`

5–15 atomic Q/A pairs in `Q::A` format (Anki-importable). At least 2 must be deep-reasoning (causal/counterfactual).

```
Q:: What's the safety property Raft enforces, in one sentence?
A:: At most one log entry can be committed at a given index across all terms — no two leaders ever commit conflicting entries.

Q:: If a network partition isolates the leader, why doesn't the partition's followers commit log entries?
A:: They lack a majority quorum, so AppendEntries cannot achieve replication-to-majority; the leader on the minority side cannot advance the commit index.
```

These also append to `learner/review-queue.md`.

### `## Sources`

Two sub-lists with URLs and access dates:

- **[verified]** — sources fetched/cited during the session.
- **[from-training, verify]** — claims from model training rather than tool-grounded retrieval. Flagged so future-you knows to verify.

### `## Next`

2–3 follow-on lesson suggestions, with one-line rationale each. Written into `learner/topic-index.md`.

## What NOT to put in a lesson artifact

- Proprietary code. No `~/Work/*` snippets, no internal service names, no employer-identifiable scenarios.
- Filler ("In conclusion...", "Hopefully this was helpful...").
- Fabricated quotes from real engineers.
- Diagrams without captions. Every Mermaid block has a one-line caption above it.
