# Source Canon — 2026-Current

**Currency is non-negotiable.** Wasting time learning a take the field has already moved past is a core failure mode for any technical learner (and an explicit fear for many). Every lesson must be grounded in current material.

This file is **not** the set of sources a lesson is permitted to cite. It is two things:

1. A **vetted floor** — sources already explored and confirmed load-bearing in 2026. Cite them freely; they are a shortcut for exploration already done. Their presence here does **not** mean they are the only good sources, and their absence does **not** mean a source is disallowed.
2. A **stale-list** — sources explicitly avoided. *This* is the currency guardrail, not the floor.

**Every lesson runs a source-discovery pass** (see `primer/lesson-protocol.md`): the Primer actively searches for current sources on the specific topic, beyond the floor, vets them against the stale-criteria below, and cites them with the usual tags. The floor is where a lesson *starts*, never where it *stops*. A closed allowlist would freeze knowledge at the moment the list was written — the opposite of the goal.

This file is a living document. Each session checks `freshness_check` in its frontmatter; if the canon is more than ~3 months stale at session start, re-validate before grounding claims. Sources that prove load-bearing in a lesson get promoted back into the floor at recap (see *Refreshing this file*), so the floor grows from real use.

## Vetted floor — starter pack (load-bearing in 2026)

## Source-discovery pass (every lesson)

Before the Deepen body, the Primer spends real effort finding current sources on the *specific* topic — not just reaching into the floor above. The floor saves time on the broad strokes; the discovery pass catches what's newer, more specific, or has moved since the floor was last touched.

What the pass does:

1. **Search** for current material on the exact topic (official docs, recent talks/papers, maintained projects, primary-source blogs from credible practitioners).
2. **Vet** each candidate against the stale-criteria below. A source that fails is dropped, not cited.
3. **Cite** survivors in `sources_consulted` with `[verified via docs]` (fetched this session) or `[from-training, verify]` tags.
4. **Promote** any source that proved load-bearing into the floor at recap.

The pass is mandatory even for topics with strong floor coverage — the floor ages, and the field moves between sessions.

## Stale-criteria (how to vet a candidate)

A source is stale — and excluded regardless of where it was found — if any hold:

- It predates a known consensus shift in its domain (see *Cross-cutting shifts* below) and hasn't been updated past it.
- A maintained successor exists that the field has moved to (e.g., a 1st ed. when a current ed. ships; a site that's actively maintained vs. a frozen book).
- It teaches a pattern the field has explicitly cooled on (e.g., "event-source everything," Alpine-as-default).
- The author/version/RFC claims can't be grounded and the topic is version- or API-specific.

## Stale list (named instances to avoid)

- Pre-2024 LangChain monolith tutorials — superseded by Anthropic "Building Effective Agents" + LangGraph + Pydantic AI.
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications, 1st ed. (2017) — noticeably dated on cloud and streaming. Use 2nd ed.
- "Microservices Patterns" book (Richardson, 2018) — use the actively-maintained microservices.io site + Dudycz.
- Burns, "Designing Distributed Systems" (2018) — use Brooker + 6.5840 + Jepsen.
- Alpine-as-default Dockerfiles — distroless / Chainguard are the current default.
- Older Coursera "Cloud Computing Specialization" / Udemy distsys — replaced by 6.5840 + DDIA 2nd ed.
- "Use Paxos" content from before ~2020 — Raft + practical-Paxos variants are the current teaching path.
- "Event-source everything" content — the field has cooled. Outbox-first; sagas only for true cross-service workflows.

---

## Cross-cutting shifts to encode (2024–2026)

- **Agents:** consensus has moved from "use a framework" to "use simple, composable LLM-call patterns; reach for LangGraph/Pydantic AI when you need durable state." MCP is now the tool-calling standard — teach it at the same level as HTTP, not as an optional extra.
- **Distributed systems:** less "implement Paxos," more "understand replication / consistency / failure modes well enough to read a Jepsen report." Formal methods (TLA+, P) are entering practitioner mainstream via Brooker/AWS.
- **Event-driven:** outbox-first; sagas only for true cross-service workflows; full event sourcing only for audit/finance domains.
- **Containers:** distroless/Chainguard have displaced Alpine-as-default; BuildKit features (cache mounts, secrets, bake) are no longer optional.
- **Backend thinking:** the staff-engineer vocabulary (scope, leverage, glue work) has become standard; system design is increasingly *operational* (capacity, on-call, blast radius) rather than purely architectural.

## Refreshing this file

Two triggers keep the floor current:

**Per-lesson promotion (every session).** A source surfaced during the discovery pass that proved load-bearing for the lesson gets added to the floor at recap, with its tag. This is the primary growth path — the floor accretes from real use, not from scheduled reviews.

**Periodic re-validation (`freshness_check` > ~3 months).** The skill should:

1. Spawn a research subagent to verify each domain's floor is still load-bearing.
2. Surface new sources that have entered lessons or conversation (high signal: new books, talks at major conferences, projects with rapid star growth).
3. Demote any floor entry that now fails the stale-criteria into the stale list.
4. Update this file and bump the date.

The deep `recalibrate` ritual (see `primer/feedback-protocol.md`) also flags floor entries that have gone stale.

Prefer fewer, higher-quality sources over comprehensive lists. When in doubt, cut.
