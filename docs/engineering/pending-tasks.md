# Pending Tasks

Live checklist for primer engineering. `session-end` checks off / prunes completed items and adds new ones. Completed work lives permanently in the session notes, not here.

## Next Up

- [ ] **Run a real intake** (`/primer init`) to replace the generic migrated profile with a rich, evidence-backed one in primer-data.
- [ ] Confirm `session-start`/`session-end` skills match the house style after first real use.

### From Proposal 0001 (cold review — see `proposals/0001-cold-review-and-improvements.md`)

Wave A — corrections (factual + de-personalization), low risk: **[done — Session 3]**
- [x] **C4** — fixed overstated effect-size claims in `REQUIREMENTS.md §2`; tagged AutoTutor claim.
- [x] **C3** — tagged canon floor edition/date entries `[edition — verify]`; added verify discipline.
- [x] **C1** — de-personalized `system-prompt.md`; canon → starter pack; per-instance domain list; generalized `anti-patterns.md` #4 + fixed stale depth-marker path.

Wave B — close the feedback loop (the structural fix): **[done — Session 3]**
- [x] **C2** — forgetting-aware confidence decay + bidirectional confidence + decay in minor-recalibrate.
- [x] **T1** — `/primer review` miss → calibration-log + confidence drop.
- [x] **E1** — cold-retrieval score recorded; `review-queue.md` Review-history section (self-authored caveat).
- [x] **T7** — "just show me" escape hatch gated on struggle-tolerance.
- [x] Promoted to `DECISIONS.md`: D-0014 (no hardcoded learner), D-0015 (external anchor + decay), D-0016 (effect-size target).

Wave C — quality & hygiene: **[done — Session 3]**
- [x] **T2** — prompt-quality rubric (Matuschak's 5 attributes + conceptual pattern language) + self-check.
- [x] **T5** — reconciled resume/artifact path → sidecar `<date>-<slug>.STATE.md` (SKILL.md, lesson-template, .gitignore).
- [x] **T6** — privacy hardening documented in README (recommended global `~/.claude/settings.json` deny block; repo `.claude/*` is gitignored).
- [x] **T4** — evidence-triggered recalibration (M=4 misses OR N=8 cap); D-0017 supersedes D-0004's fixed N=5.

Wave D — resolved into goals + Proposal 0002:
- [x] **T3** — resolved: self-contained in-repo scheduling (not Anki). Folded into Proposal 0002. (D-0018)
- [x] New goals captured: **D-0018** (self-contained; bookkeeping-as-code), **D-0019** (Goal 5 — cultivate learning habits). Anchor reworked onto the lesson flow (Elicit recall); `/primer review` now optional + habit-building.
- [x] **E3** — generation-effect tweak (learner states the takeaway before the Primer summarizes). `lesson-protocol.md §5`.
- [x] Consistency sweep: fixed stale "every 5 lessons" in SKILL.md and two depth-marker→`profile.md` paths (→ `topic-index.md`).
- [ ] **E2** / **E4** — still deferred until post-use data.

### Proposal 0002 — deterministic state layer + habit-formation: **[decided & built — D-0020]**

See `proposals/0002-…md`. Decisions resolved:
- [x] **Source of truth** — markdown stays source of truth; **no SQLite** (binary-in-git breaks cross-machine sync; no scale benefit). A gitignored rebuildable cache is a future option only.
- [x] **Scheduler** — SM-2 (FSRS deferred until there's review volume).
- [x] **Build order** — state layer first. **Script language** — Python 3.11+ stdlib-only (portable).
- [x] Built `tools/primer_state.py` + `tools/test_primer_state.py` (19 tests passing) + `tools/README.md`; wired into SKILL.md / feedback-protocol.md / review-queue template.

### Next up (morning)
- [ ] Run a real `/primer init` intake against the de-personalized engine, writing into the new state layer (first true end-to-end run).
- [ ] Verify `init-instance.sh` seeds the new `review-queue.md` format on a fresh instance.
- [ ] Consider merging `proposal-0001-review-and-fixes` → `main` (rebase first; `origin/main` advanced).
- [ ] Remaining habit-formation surface (proactive nudges, retention-trend payoff, meta-learning asides) — grow with real use.

## Done (this session)

- [x] Wave 1: intake, feedback cycle, currency reframe, profile restructure.
- [x] init-instance.sh + `~/.config/primer/config` + data-repo layout.
- [x] Engineering logs (GOALS, DECISIONS, sessions, these docs) + session skills.
- [x] Class/instance split + migration: `voidnologo/primer-data` (private) created and pushed; personal data removed from core.
- [x] Rename to `primer` (skill name + verbs, install.sh, README, REQUIREMENTS, memory). Live skill reinstalled as `/primer`.
- [x] GitHub repo renamed `knowledge → primer` (`voidnologo/primer`), remote updated, pushed. Local dir moved to `~/personal/learning/primer`.
- [x] Lessons reframed as private-by-default (D-0013); `examples/` removed from the public core.

## Ideas / proposals (not committed)

- **Lesson → public-artifact derivation skill** (D-0013): take a personal lesson from the private instance and derive a sanitized, shareable artifact on demand. The only sanctioned path to a public lesson.
- Tune `N` (minor-recalibrate cadence) after real lesson data; currently 5. *(Superseded by Proposal 0001 T4 — make recalibration evidence-triggered rather than a fixed count.)*
- Possible `/primer config` verb to set N and register without a full recalibrate.
- Consider a "transfer-confirm" micro-probe in the first lesson that touches an assumed-held skill (closes the Phase-3 transfer assumption).
